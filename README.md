Challenge for week 5

## Description

I started this project knowing that Jquerey could be useful for generating specified criteria. The goal of this project was to create a webpage that acts as a calendar for the current day. I created functions for putting the current date on the page, for selecting what color each time box is, and to save the input data locally when the save button is clicked. I learned that using Jquerey and bootstrap for the cade makes things much easier to follow and allows things to use less code to get the same result.

## Installation

In order to start this project I had to pull the starting code from the class Gitlab and copy the files to my local repository. After that I pushed everything to a remote repository that I had created for the project to keep everything backed up and up to date.

## Usage

active webpage link:

This webpage is to be used to keep track of tasks to be completed throughout your day
